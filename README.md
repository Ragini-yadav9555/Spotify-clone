This is a **Spotify Clone** created using **HTML** and **CSS** to mimic the user interface of the popular music streaming platform, **Spotify**. The project focuses on replicating the layout and style of Spotify’s homepage and sidebar with a fully responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.

### Features:
- **Responsive Layout:** The clone is designed to be mobile-friendly, with a layout that adjusts based on screen size.
- **Stylish User Interface:** The clone includes a clean and modern UI, similar to Spotify's design, featuring a sidebar, navigation buttons, and album art.
- **Hover Effects:** Smooth hover effects and transitions are applied to various elements to enhance the user experience.

This project is built with **HTML** for the structure and **CSS** for the styling and layout. It doesn’t include any JavaScript functionality for playing music or interaction with a real backend, but it serves as a great front-end exercise to build a responsive, stylish music streaming platform clone.

This clone provides a great opportunity to practice front-end development skills and familiarize oneself with the basic layout techniques and styling principles used in modern web design.
